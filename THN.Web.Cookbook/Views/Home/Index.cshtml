        This project contains a simple recipe application with all the necessary CRUD functions.
        In each of the menu items above, you should be able to see a list of recipes that you can
        search trhough.  Clicking the "edit" link should take you to a form that allows you to edit
        the recipe and add notse.  Clicking the "print" link should present the recipe in a printer 
        friendly manner.<br />
        Project Details:
        <ul>
            <li>The application uses Entity Framework on the backend with data migrations enabled. 
                The database should create itself when the application is run for the first time. 
                You may need to run "update-database" to get the seed data to populate.</li>
            <li>This application uses a "code first" approach with optomistic locking.  Lock
                messages are displayed as error messages that allows the user to reload the recipe
                or abandon all changes.</li>
            <li>The controllers are synchronous.</li>
            <li>The Unit Test are for the controllers only.</li>
            <li>The AngularJS controllers are tested using Jasmine and Karma.</li>
            <li>The JavaScript version (Cookbook JS SPA) is written with a "one controller to rule them
                all" approach.</li>
            <li>The TypeScript version (Cookbook TS SPA) is written with client side routing where AngularJS
                handles the views. There is a special route added to the route config to enable the client 
                routing to function.</li>
            <li>This is the project I use to test new ideas and new technologies.  As such it is constantly in 
                flux.  If something doesn't work it's because I'm trying new things.</li>
        </ul>
